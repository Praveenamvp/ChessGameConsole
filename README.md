Chess Game 
This ChessGame is a console-based chess application written in C#. It allows two players to play chess on the command line by entering moves in the format of 'a1', 'b2', etc.
The game supports standard chess rules and movement patterns for each chess piece.

White is the first player to enter the game.
Enter the piece's position (for example, "e2") and hit Enter to move it.
Then the application will show the choices that are legal for that item.
To move the piece, type the new position (for example, "e4") and hit Enter.
The piece will be moved to the new location and the board will be updated if the move is legal.
The captured piece of the opponent will be shown on the console if the move succeeds in doing so.
The game goes on until either a player wins or all of the players want to leave.

"Exit" ends the game and closes the programme.
Without making any moves, "Print" shows the board's present state.Chess Game Console
